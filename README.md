# Prediction-of-Heart-Diseases-using-Random-Forest
The objective of the work is to predicts the occurrence
of heart disease of a patient using random forest algorithm.
The dataset was accessed from Kaggle site. The dataset contains
1025 samples and 14 attributes are taken for features of the
dataset. Then it was processed using python open access software
in jupyter notebook. The datasets are classified and processed
using machine learning algorithm Random forest. The outcomes
of the dataset are expressed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity
and specificity in percentage. Using random forest algorithm, we
obtained accuracy of 99 percent for prediction of heart disease .
The random forest algorithm has proven to be the most efficient
algorithm for classification of heart disease and therefore it is
used in the proposed system.m
